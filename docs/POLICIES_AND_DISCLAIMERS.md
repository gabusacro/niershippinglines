# Nier Shipping Lines — Policies, Disclaimers & User Information

This document captures policies, refund rules, schedule changes, and privacy considerations for inclusion in Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and user-facing disclaimers.

---

## 1. Refunds

- **Refund eligibility**: Refunds are subject to admin, captain, and ticket booth crew approval.
- **Notice period**: Passengers should notify at least **2 days before** the scheduled departure if they cannot board or have an emergency. Early notification improves refund or schedule-change options.
- **No-show policy**: Unused tickets (passenger did not board on the scheduled date) are **not** automatically refundable. It is the passenger's responsibility to process a refund request or schedule change before departure if they cannot travel.
- **Refund process**: Contact the ticket booth, admin, or company channels. Refund requests are reviewed case-by-case. Approved refunds are processed back to the original payment method.

## 2. Schedule Changes

- **Change requests**: Passengers may request to change their trip date/time. Changes are subject to admin, captain, and ticket booth crew approval.
- **Availability**: Changes depend on seat availability on the requested alternative trip.
- **Fees**: Additional fees may apply for schedule changes; this is determined by the company.
- **Cut-off**: Schedule change requests should be made at least **2 days before** the original departure when possible.

## 3. Deletion of Trips, Routes & Vessels

- **Current/future tickets**: Trips, routes, and vessels **cannot be deleted** while they have confirmed passengers on **current or future** departures. Those bookings must be reassigned or refunded first.
- **Past trips (no-shows)**: Trips whose departure date has **already passed** may be deleted even if they had confirmed passengers who did not board. Non-use of a ticket is not grounds for automatic refund after the fact.
- **Vessel removal**: A vessel can be deleted only when it has no current or future confirmed tickets. Past trip data (including vessel name) is preserved in passenger booking history for reference.

---

## 4. Passenger Booking History

- **Retention**: Previous bookings remain visible in the passenger's account for **1 year** for reference.
- **Preserved information**: Even when a trip, vessel, or route is removed from the system, the passenger's history retains:
  - Booking reference
  - Route name
  - Vessel name (at time of confirmation)
  - Departure date and time
  - Fare and payment details
- **Purpose**: This information is kept so passengers can reference past travel (e.g. for expense reports, records) regardless of whether the vessel is still in service.

---

## 5. User Interactions & Privacy

- **Account data**: Email, name, and booking history are stored for account and booking management.
- **Payment**: Payment details (e.g. GCash reference) and proof of payment may be stored for verification. Card numbers are not stored.
- **Crew/staff access**: Admin, captains, and ticket booth crew can view and manage bookings relevant to their role. QR-code ticket scanning is used for validation and check-in.
- **Communication**: Emails may be sent for booking confirmations, payment reminders, and refund notifications. Contact details are used only for booking-related communication.
- **Data retention**: Booking history is retained for at least 1 year. Older data may be archived or anonymized per company policy.

---

## 6. E-Ticket & QR Code

- **Format**: Confirmed tickets include a QR code. Crew may scan the QR code via mobile camera to validate and check in passengers.
- **Security**: Each QR code encodes the booking reference and passenger index. Only authorized crew (admin, ticket booth, captain) can validate tickets.
- **Presentation**: Passengers should present the ticket (digital or printed) at the ticket booth. Bring valid ID.

## 7. Website & Service Use

- **Accuracy**: Schedules and fares are subject to change. The company reserves the right to modify routes, times, and vessels.
- **Weather & safety**: Trips may be cancelled or delayed due to weather, safety, or operational reasons. Passengers will be notified when possible.
- **Liability**: Use of the website and ferry service is subject to the company's terms. The company is not liable for passenger no-shows or failure to request refunds/schedule changes in time.
